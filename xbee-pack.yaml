  The Gzip package contains programs for compressing and decompressing files.
  Installed programs: gunzip, gzexe, gzip, uncompress (hard link with gunzip), zcat, zcmp, zdiff, zegrep, zfgrep, zforce, zgrep, zless, zmore, and znew
  Short Descriptions
    gunzip: Decompresses gzipped files
    gzexe: Creates self-decompressing executable files
    gzip: Compresses the given files using Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) coding
    uncompress: Decompresses compressed files
    zcat: Decompresses the given gzipped files to standard output
    zcmp: Runs cmp on gzipped files
    zdiff: Runs diff on gzipped files
    zegrep: Runs egrep on gzipped files
    zfgrep: Runs fgrep on gzipped files
    zforce: Forces a .gz extension on all given files that are gzipped files, so that gzip will not compress them again; this can be useful when file names were truncated during a file transfer
    zgrep: Runs grep on gzipped files
    zless: Runs less on gzipped files
    zmore: Runs more on gzipped files
    znew: Re-compresses files from compress format to gzip formatâ€”.Z to .gz
